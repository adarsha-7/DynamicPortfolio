# Dynamic Portfolio
### This is my personal portfolio website â€” a feature-rich and dynamic platform that highlights my skills, showcases my projects, and stands out as a unique and robust creation.
## Features: 
#### The visitors can contact the admin directly through the website by sending messages. The admin is notified immediately in real time using Websocket if active and message is sent to admin panel, which the admin can view.
